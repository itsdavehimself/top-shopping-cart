# Storefront & Shopping Cart Project

## Project Description/Objectives

Welcome to my Shopping Cart App, a fun project born out of my journey through The Odin Project's JavaScript/React curriculum. Designed to showcase my skills as a junior web developer, this project explores the realms of ReactJS, React routing, and is complemented by the use of CSS modules.

The primary goal of this project is to delve into the intricacies of ReactJS, emphasizing the practical implementation of React components, state management, and routing.

### Key Features:

- **RESTful API Integration:** This project seamlessly integrates with Best Buy's API to dynamically fetch and display up-to-date product information on the site. Leveraging the principles of REST, it ensures efficient communication between the client and the external data source.

- **Dynamic Shopping Cart:** The shopping cart allows users to effortlessly add up to five units of a product. Experience real-time total updates, conveniently displayed in the navbar for quick reference. A playful checkout button triggers a fun confetti show, adding a touch of joy to the user experience.

- **Responsive Design for Seamless Shopping:** Enjoy a seamless shopping experience across a variety of devices. Whether you're on desktop or mobile, the responsive design ensures an optimal and user-friendly interface, making your browsing and shopping effortless.

- **Technological Showcase:** This project serves as a comprehensive showcase of my React development skills. Leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as Vite, React, and React Router, the project demonstrates proficiency in state management through both local and global context. CSS modules are employed for maintainable styling, creating a visually appealing user interface. Additionally, the integration of a RESTful API design highlights my commitment to building dynamic and data-driven web applications.
